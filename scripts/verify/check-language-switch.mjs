/**
 * Clicks the translate widget the way a reader reaches it, and checks where it lands.
 *
 *   node scripts/build/site.mjs && python -m zensical build -f course-site.yml
 *   node scripts/verify/check-language-switch.mjs
 *
 * check-nav.mjs reads the built HTML, which is the state of a page opened
 * directly, and there the picker is always right. A reader does not open a lab
 * directly: they land on the home page and walk through the menu. The theme
 * navigates without reloading and swaps the container, the logo and the header
 * title, never the rest of the header, so the picker kept the links of the page
 * they landed on and sent them to the home page of the other language.
 * site-theme/javascripts/language-switch.js rebuilds them, and only a browser
 * can say that it does.
 *
 * The same goes for the choice being remembered: picking a language writes a
 * cookie, and the next page opened in the other language moves to it before it
 * is painted. Nothing in the built HTML shows that either.
 *
 * It serves the built site on a port of its own, so run the site build first.
